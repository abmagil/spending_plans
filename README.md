# Welcome to the scratch space of Aaron B Magil

_I'm a developer, focused on bulding tools that people can use to better
understand the world around them_

Changing your users' lives can take many flavors, and can happen on any side of
the stack- neither Front-End nor Back-End developers lay sole claim to it. I
think developers should become [t-shaped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills)
in order to not simply speak Ruby or Javascript, but instead learn how the
business' unique domain works, thinks, and speaks. A developer's job is to use
all the tools in their toolbox to translate for domain experts.

As I discover new technologies and new programming paradigms, I attempt to use
them to rebuild the same solution to a problem- specifically, the problem of
planning how to use one's money to achieve one's goals. You can investigate the
details in the README's for each solution.
